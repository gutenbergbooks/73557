<h2 class="nopb">I.—GENERAL.</h2>

<p>The systematic examination of the geological structure of Egypt,
carried out by the Geological Survey during the last thirteen
years, has, in conjunction with previous studies, revealed the fact
that the surface of the country is composed of very varied
materials: limestones, sands, clays, sandstones, granites, schists,
etc. The co-ordination of view as to the distribution of these
rocks<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> presented by a geological map has further shown
that they are not arranged in a random manner, but that certain
very definite relations exist between them. If, for instance, the
Moqattam hills behind the Citadel be ascended, the lower part of
the scarp is found to be composed of white limestone, which is
capped by a series of sandy limestones and clays differing alike in
colour and in the rapidity with which they are worn away by the
streams, due to the rare but destructive winter rains. Finally, the
summit is crowned by beds in which boulders of flint and quartz
play the most important part, the matrix of sand which bound them
together having long been removed by the action of the wind.</p>

<p>Similarly, if we were to go southward towards Aswan, a change
would be noted in the character and composition of the rocks which
form the cliffs bordering the Nile Valley. From Cairo to Qena,
limestones predominate; but from thence southward to Esna, clays
play a large part at the base of the limestones, and the slipping
of the latter over these softer members has given rise to the
“tumbled” country which is so conspicuous a feature between Armant
and Matana. South of Esna the clays in their turn disappear, while
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> sandstone which is
seen underlying them near Mahamid becomes the dominant constituent
of the hills from near Edfu to the neighbourhood of Aswan; at this
locality the sandstone itself vanishes, except in so far as it
forms isolated caps on the granite, which is the principal rock in
the well-known district of the First Cataract.</p>

<p>The same lesson as to the order of succession of the rocks in
Egypt is forced home if we move from Qena eastward to the Red Sea
hills, or south-westward to Kharga Oasis. East of Qena the clays
are a conspicuous feature at the base of the outlying limestone
hills (Abu Had, etc.), and in their turn rest on sandstone, which
forms striking plateaus seamed by deep ravines giving entry to the
heart of the Red Sea hills. On traversing these gorges, a confused
hill-country of granite (worn into boulders on the surface), or
dark-green schists is entered, on whose summits the sandstone
occurs as isolated outliers near the main sandstone mass, but to
the east disappears altogether.</p>

<p>Similarly, going westward and crossing the great limestone
desert, on reaching the edge of the scarp which bounds the oases,
clays appear from under the limestones, and in their turn overlie
sandstones forming the floors of the oasis depressions. Closer
examination reveals the fact that in the upper part of the
sandstone series seams of clay alternate with the sandy layers, and
in that part of the cliff where clay bands predominate, beds of
limestone alternate with them.</p>

<p>In broad outline, it may be stated that in southern Egypt,
limestone rests on clays alternating with limestone, these on
sandstones which in their upper part alternate with clay, and the
sandstone on granite and metamorphic rocks (slates, schists, etc.).
The inclination or dip of the various beds is such that should a
boring be made through the limestone near Cairo, one might expect
to reach first a succession of beds where clay was predominant,
followed by beds of sandstone, and finally the series of which the
granite of Aswan is a conspicuous member.<a id=
"FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In
northern Egypt, the conditions are reversed, sandstones and clays
<em>overlying</em> the limestones near Cairo, but never attaining
the extent and importance of those exposed to view in the
south.</p>

<p>These facts require an explanation—the one furnished by
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> science of Geology,
being briefly as follows: Each of the rocks observed has a definite
origin or formation; the nature of their present distribution is
due to subsequent movement, or deformation; the various
meteorological agencies at work lead to the transformation of the
original structures, resulting in the formation of a new series of
rocks composed of materials derived from the wearing away of the
older deposits.</p>

<h2 class="nopb">II.—ORIGIN OR FORMATION OF ROCKS.</h2>

<p>The simplest illustration of the formation of a rock is one
which may be observed by the dweller in Egypt every year during the
Nile flood. The “red water” of the Nile, if collected during this
period, and evaporated to dryness, leaves behind it the
fine-grained sediment, or Nile mud, forming the soil to which this
land owes its fertility; while in the central portions of the
river, the coarser material, consisting largely of sand-grains, is
being transported by the stronger current. As a result, the river
flows for the main part over a sandy bed, the clays being
restricted to the sides where the water is moving less swiftly, or
to the fields on which the finer sediment is deposited. This “red
water” has been traced step by step to its parent source, and has
been proved to be derived from the wearing away of the
widely-spread volcanic rocks of Abyssinia, disintegrated by
differences of temperature, etc., and denuded by the destructive
rainstorms which break over that region in the early summer. It is
equally a matter of experience that on drying, this sediment passes
from the condition of a soft and sticky mud to a hard and resistant
clay, which, drying during the heat of the summer, cracks in every
direction. The fluviatile character of these clay deposits is often
revealed by the presence of the river shells enclosed in them, and
in each succeeding year slight differences in composition in the
material brought down are indicated by the layers being sharply
marked off from one another, and so presenting the familiar
stratified appearance. Again, much sand and clay is being carried
seaward and deposited, the former, in general, nearer the land on
account of its greater specific gravity and less finely divided
character.</p>

<p>These clays and sands are forming both on the land and in the
sea, a point which does not need elaboration, but when
considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> the origin
of the limestones, and how it is that they seem at times to be
built up of fossil shells, as a rule the general student would be
at a loss for an answer. The researches in the great oceans, which
have been carried on with such assiduity during recent years, have
shown that the upper layers of their waters are crowded with a vast
number of living organisms, apparently simple in structure, but
having the power of extracting the carbonate of lime in solution
and constructing shells of complicated and beautiful form. As the
animals die, these tiny shells rain down to the bed of the ocean,
slowly forming a muddy white calcareous paste which encloses the
sea-urchins and other marine animals living in the depths of the
sea. Thus, step by step, muds (which on drying are as genuine
limestones as any now forming the cliffs and scarps of Egypt) are
laid down on one another, separated into strata whenever some
external change, such as the addition of some clayey matter
transported from a river in flood, slightly alters the composition.
The alteration is subsequently indicated either by variation in
tint or by differing resistance to the wearing influences of the
meteorological agencies. But how are these argillaceous muds
transformed into the solid clays, the sands into sandstones, and
the calcareous muds into fossiliferous limestones? How have these
loose materials become consolidated so as to form the compact
rock-masses with which we become acquainted in the most casual
study of the physical structure of Egypt?</p>

<h2 class="nopb">III.—DEFORMATION OF ROCKS.</h2>

<p>Examination of the rock exposures at many localities in the
neighbourhood of Cairo bears witness to the fact that the strata of
limestone which were laid down horizontally upon the bed of the sea
are no longer in the position they once occupied, but are now
inclined to the horizontal plane at angles which are easily
perceptible. This is especially noticeable in the two shallow
cuttings under the Great Pyramid, where the strata are inclined 5
degrees to the south, revealing the reason why the whole Pyramid
slope descends so rapidly in the southward direction. Again, if
standing at the base of the same mighty structure, the gaze be
allowed to wander over the broad expanse of the Nile Valley to the
scarp of the Moqattam hills behind the Citadel, it will be seen
that the white limestone of their lower slopes forms, not a
long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> horizontal wall,
but an arch, sloping strongly both north and south of the Citadel.
There has been obviously change of form, but how has it taken
place?</p>

<p>We learn with surprise that an earthquake shock in distant San
Francisco or in the inhospitable regions of Turkestan has recorded
itself through the delicately-poised recorder at Helwan, long
before the dire news of destruction has flashed along the telegraph
wire to the same destination. There is a realization of the
instability of the earth’s crust, in spite of the solidarity of its
component parts, but though the sudden shocks bring home this
truth, it is not so readily grasped that day by day and hour by
hour parts of the earth’s crust are slowly rising and others
sinking, offering stern problems to the dwellers on the shores
where these changes are most markedly taking place. On the eastern
shores of England, towns and forests are being submerged beneath
the relentless advance of the sea; on the coasts of the
Scandinavian peninsula, etc., on the other hand, beaches formerly
beneath the sea now stand high above the influence of its waves,
and in Egypt coral-reefs which once grew beneath the waters of the
Red Sea rise in places to over two hundred metres above it in bold
hills or steep-sided terraces. Though possibly of far greater
importance and significance than the sudden convulsions which have
left so deep an impression on the mind of man, these movements are
nevertheless so imperceptible that they arouse little
attention.</p>

<p>A second type of deformation is noted where heavy masses of one
rock rest on other and softer materials. The underlying beds are
then often compressed and contorted; clays, for instance, are drawn
out into thinner laminæ, giving rise to shales, while the massive
rocks above either slip on the surface of the lower ones, if these
be impermeable, and so permit of a water-layer forming along the
junction, or else descend by sheer weight, producing a confused
area of mixed materials in front of the still unshattered cliffs.
Examples of this nature abound in Egypt wherever the Eocene
limestones rest on the Cretaceous clays; on the railway from Armant
to Matana the resulting effects are well observed near Shagab. Here
in the main cliff the massive limestones are seen resting on the
soft bluish clays, while in front is a wilderness of low hills in
which limestones and clays are mixed, broken and contorted. But
while these deformations may be irregular and local, there remain
greater pressure-effects which have been regional in<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> character, and by whose agency the
solid rocks have been folded in the most remarkable manner, strata
once horizontal being thrown into arches, or anticlines, and
basin-like curves, or synclines. The importance of these changes
cannot be over-estimated, and some of the marked features of
Egyptian scenery depend directly on these effects. Reference has
already been made to the slope of the Pyramid plateau, but the
character of Egypt in far broader outline depends on the results of
these pressures and the foldings so produced. A glance at the map
suffices to show that many of the salient features in this country
present a remarkable similarity and parallelism. The eastern
cliff-wall of Kharga Oasis preserves a notable parallelism to a
portion of the Nile Valley, though the latter be separated by many
kilometres of wild desert plateau from the oasis; another portion
of the Nile Valley also agrees with the Gulf of Suez in the broad
outlines of its trend.</p>

</div>

<p>A section taken from Baharia or Kharga Oasis to the shores of
the Red Sea reveals the fact that Egypt proper is bounded on the
west by a low flat arch which has brought the underlying sandstones
nearer to the surface, giving rise to the great oases.<a id=
"FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
These are mainly present in the sandstone areas, and are in part
bounded by cliff-walls composed in many instances of clays at the
base and limestones at the summit. To the east, on the other hand,
rise the Red Sea hills, the central core of a steeply inclined arch
in which the resistant granites and schists now rise high above the
low-lying sandstone country which flanks them. Between these two
arches is the flat-bedded syncline in which the nummulitic
limestone is the conspicuous member, the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_7">[7]</span> strata in central Egypt having in consequence a
half cup-shaped form, of which one half, the northern, may have
disappeared by fracture beneath the waters of the Mediterranean
Sea. This cup-like structure may be due to Egypt having not only
been folded in a north-west and south-east direction but also
almost at right angles, this latter folding giving rise to such
remarkable features as the Wadi Araba, the Qena bend, and possibly
affording the fundamental explanation for the great S-shaped bends
of the Nile. In other and more mountainous regions, such as the
Alps and Himalayas, these solid earth-waves may be under such
immense pressure that their crests begin first to turn over like
those of an advancing wave of the sea, and then may be broken in
such a way that mighty masses of strata are rent asunder, those
portions which are uppermost being thrust for great distances over
the underlying beds. These extreme folds ending in fracture, or
overthrusts, are as yet but little known in Egypt, though Dr. Ball
has reported an interesting case from the neighbourhood of Abu
Harba, and some of the phenomena of dislocation observed near the
borders of the Gulf of Suez may possibly be explained as resulting
from movements of this nature.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw4">
<figure id="i2"><img src='images/i2.jpg' alt=''>
<p>Fig. 2.—Overfolding of Strata.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>These intense movements become masked under the influence of the
denuding hand of time, the contorted strata may again sink beneath
the sea, new beds are laid down horizontally on the upturned edges
of the older series and the result is the production of an
unconformity between the two members, which differ in age, in
inclination, and in fossil character. Sometimes rolled fragments of
the older stratum are interposed between it and the new overlying
beds, further revealing the activity of denudation before the newer
member began to be deposited.</p>

<p>If fracture by overthrust be unknown in Egypt, another type of
fracture has produced effects of a far-reaching character. In
certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> regions of the
earth, folding is no longer the conspicuous method by which the
rock-components of its crust are displaced with regard to one
another. In many instances small fissures have been observed in
which the beds on one side have been thrown down to a lower level
than they are on the other. These faults are frequently the result
of great earthquakes, many striking examples of such occurrences
having been noted during the major earth-movements within the last
hundred years. It is probable, indeed, that many of the most
important of these, such as the destructive earthquake of Messina,
are due to further settling of the strata in relation to
fracture-lines already determined. Naturally, this implies that
there are certain spaces formed deep beneath the earth’s surface,
which permit of these efforts to restrengthen the weak spots by
filling up the gaps. In the extreme outskirts of Egypt these
fault-lines have produced marvellous and striking effects, the most
conspicuous being the remarkable depression which, commencing at
the Gulf of Aqaba, penetrates far into the continent of Asia,
giving rise to the Dead Sea (many hundred metres below the level of
the Mediterranean), to the Jordan Valley, to the Lake of Tiberias,
and the valley which continues this line northward. I have had the
opportunity of personally studying some of these fault-lines in the
Sinai peninsula, tracing them from an arched fold in the north,
whose sides were being let down by faults in a series of steps, to
a trough-fault,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> in
which the younger strata are displaced bodily between the older
ones. Where undisturbed, the succession in Sinai shows sandstone
lying on granite, and limestone (containing definite groups of
fossils) on sandstone. In the valleys due to these trough-faults,
the granite hills tower 500 metres on each side, capped by small
outlying fragments of the overlying sandstone, whereas in the
valley itself the only rocks visible are limestones and sandstones
often tilted at high angles, and thus revealing the tremendous
displacement to which they have been subjected.</p>

<p>Fig 4.—Fault exhibited by a Coal-seam.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Considering the earth-movements of Egypt as a whole, the
evidence shows folding to have been the more important type of
displacement on its western side, and intense faulting to have been
most conspicuous in the east, while between these two extremes, the
relative importance of folding and faulting will remain a contested
point. The discussion will only close when the borders of the Nile
Valley and the Gulf of Suez have been mapped with the accuracy and
precision of a Geological Survey in Europe—a pious aspiration,
whose realization can scarcely be hoped for while the broad
geological picture is still being filled in.</p>

<p>Egypt, then, has passed through a long history, of which the
following seems to be the record put in dogmatic form. The ancient
schists and granites which form the central core of its eastern
arch, or anticline, the Red Sea hills, are witnesses to a period of
sedimentation, of volcanic action, and of the influence of
deep-seated molten igneous masses. Step by step these were revealed
by denudation, becoming part of an ancient continent. In addition
to a brief marine invasion during the Carboniferous period, there
was a second advance of the sea in Cretaceous times, which is
represented first by the deposit of such coarse detrital materials
as the sands composing the Nubian sandstones. Then, as the
depression increased, only the finer clayey materials reached the
Egyptian region, and finally the sea covered, if not the whole, at
least the greater part of its area for a lengthened period. With
the close of the Eocene epoch a reverse movement set in, by which
the pure white marine limestones of the Moqattam hills were capped
by the sandy limestones and clays forming the brown-tinted beds of
their upper portion, the whole being, in its turn, covered by the
coarse flint and quartz gravel which containing silicified
trees<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> is the chief desert-former<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_10">[10]</span> in the immediate neighbourhood of Cairo,
as also of a large area in north-west Egypt. Any gain by the sea
since this period has been comparatively local and limited, and the
present conditions suggest that the land is gaining on the sea
rather than the reverse. The great fold-movements which we have
seen to determine so many important features are relatively of very
late date in this series of events, on their nature and position
depending the present character and visible extent of the different
formations.</p>

<h2 class="nopb">IV.—PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION OF ROCKS.</h2>

<p>The geological features of Egypt as presented to-day are the
results of the formation through varying conditions and the
subsequent deformation of the rocks composing its solid crust; we
may next consider the varied agencies through whose action these
are now undergoing transformation. A comparatively small portion of
this country is undergoing erosion by the sea, and if elevation be
still taking place, there is rather gain from the sea than
destruction by it.</p>

<p>Very different, however, are the meteorological agencies which
are at work fashioning the land as a whole, the effects of
wind-blown sand, rain, and river being of prime importance.
Different in these respects are the Eastern and Western Deserts of
Egypt. If the western border of the river be examined in Southern
Egypt, and especially in Nubia, the sight of huge masses of
golden-tinted sand filling every wind-sheltered hollow might well
leave the impression that the vast desert plain behind was covered
by a pall of sand. Closer study has shown that these wind-swept
expanses afford no protection or resting-place for the finer sands
and that consequently their floor must be formed of the more solid
materials which wind cannot carry before it. If this be realized,
no astonishment will be felt that the Libyan Desert surface is
composed of limestone, or of coarse gravels from between whose
larger fragments all the finer sand has been swept away.</p>

<p class="platelabel">[Facing p. 10.]</p>
</div>

<p>However, the wind-borne sand leaves its mark on the limestones,
which in some places are seamed by delicate grooves parallel to the
sand-blast, and in others, where they are softer, have been
sculptured into low hummocks often scattered over immense tracts of
country. The sand itself has a strangely local distribution,
advancing across the desert in lines of enormous length, and
usually trending in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
an almost meridional direction. The supply does not come from the
south or south-west, as might at first sight be expected, but from
the north, and most of the great dune-systems, which occur around
and beyond the great oases, have their termination in the southern
direction. Even the series of dunes, over 100 metres high, which
prevented the Rohlfs party advancing westward from Dakhla to Kufra,
come to an end further to the south, leaving the wide sandstone
plains bare.<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> In the oasis of Kharga the dominant longitudinal
type is replaced by huge crescentic dunes which, separated by broad
spaces clear of sand, follow one another along a north-south line,
and are not stopped in their onward march even by ridges of
considerable size. The reasons have still to be found for these
lines of special sand aggregation, though when studying the
cataract district of Amara, the initial formation of a dune-system
was seen to be determined by a local depression, which had given
sufficient protection for the formation of a sandy base on which
the dune could then be built up.</p>

<p class="platelabel">[Facing p. 11.]</p>
</div>

<p>Not only are limestones grooved and seamed, but certain areas of
the Western Desert are covered with curious melon-shaped masses,
harder concretionary portions remaining after the softer materials
of the beds have been carried away by wind-action, whereas in the
region to the east of the Nile these concretions are still enclosed
in the softer limestones.</p>

<p>Still more striking is the effect of the wind-blown sand in the
sandstone and granitic regions. Here the complex composition of the
granite has made it a ready victim. The softer felspars and mica
having been worn by the impact, leave the quartz grains loose upon
the surface, and give the rock a “frittered” appearance. Holes have
been formed in the windward side of the blocks, and the sand
contained in them clearly shows the agency to which they owe their
origin.</p>

<p>Near the eastern edge of the Western Desert the effects of
water-action become more conspicuous, on the borders of the Fayûm
terrace-formation being a marked feature, and there is a transition
to the dominant characteristics which mark the limestone country
eastward of the Nile. Here, deep and intricate valley-systems have
been cut out from a plateau which a few kilometres from the Nile is
as flat as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> great
western plains. One of the best known examples is the Wadi Hof,
near Helwan, with its ramifications, terminating in steep
cliff-faces having all the appearances of “dry waterfalls.” Any
doubt as to the active agent in their production is set at rest by
an examination of the excellent photographs taken by various
observers during the great storms which almost annually burst over
this region. (The lecture was illustrated by a series of slides
showing Wadi Hof in flood, and the cascades descending the
“waterfalls” which terminate its side-channels, these being most
kindly lent to the writer by Herr Züst, of the Electrical Service,
Ministry of Public Works). The great annual and diurnal temperature
variations (over 50° C.) aid in the work of denudation by preparing
an immense amount of broken material through the contraction and
expansion which they produce. As every material expands and
contracts according as it is heated or cooled, so the different
component parts of the rocks composing the earth’s crust are in
constant movement with regard to one another, and the less
homogeneous they are the greater the effect in breaking them up
into small masses or particles. These loosened fragments which
cover the surface of the desert are thus ready to be swept away by
the rain-waters, and as we have already seen, it is owing to these
effects, superadded to more subtle changes next to be considered,
that the old volcanic rocks of Abyssinia yield the rich silt or mud
of the Nile Valley. It would be difficult to estimate the rapidity
with which these wild ravines are being deepened by any comparison
with water-wearing effects in Europe. Any beds of soft sands and
clays are rapidly dissected by the torrent waters, a feature which
readily explains the absence of conspicuous hills in the Eastern
Desert east of Esna, where the Cretaceous clays form the dominant
constituent in the geological structure of the country. Whatever
the effects of sand-erosion in the Western Desert or rain-erosion
in the hills and on the plateaus of the Eastern Desert of Egypt,
they come relatively but little under the notice of the dweller on
the Nile, to whom the river-erosion and the reformation of new
materials become of primary importance.</p>

<p>Even the powerful agency of frost cannot be entirely dismissed
from consideration in Egypt. Owing to the expansion of water when
converted into ice, the rocks in whose cracks the water has
collected are split asunder, and as we have recently noted,
temperatures lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
than 2° C. have been recorded in Cairo during the present winter
(1910). On the great desert plateau which extends from Kharga Oasis
to the Nile Valley, temperatures of 24° F. and 30° F. were also
observed, and in the Red Sea hills and Sinai frost must be of
common occurrence, as one mountain in the latter peninsula was
ascended in snow, and the higher peaks are frequently covered in a
white pall.</p>

<p>The nature of a river system need not be dealt with in much
detail here, as I have already discussed this subject in “Survey
Notes” for April, 1907, under the title of “River Characteristics
as illustrated by the Nile.” It may be well, however, to recall
that a normal river passes through three distinct phases of
activity. In its mountain tract (for most large rivers arise in the
higher altitudes) there is maximum erosion and backward growth of
the river system. In its central portion, or valley tract, the
stream is acting as a transporter of eroded material, and such
erosion as there is, is downward rather than sideward. Finally, the
plain tract is the region of deposition of the materials so
carried, erosion being lateral, and the growth of the stream bed
forward in the form of a fan-shaped delta where the transported
sands and clays enter the sea.</p>

<p>But this general succession may be further complicated by
circumstances depending upon the geological conditions. In Egypt
and the Sudan the Nile passes from areas where it flows peacefully
and quietly, usually of considerable breadth and bounded by fertile
lands, to others in which it is restricted, dashing down steep
slopes in rapids and cataracts. A geological examination has shown
that in the first case the river is flowing over and between
sedimentary homogeneous rocks, such as the limestones and
sandstones, while in the second instance it has entered regions
composed of heterogeneous igneous and metamorphic rocks, such as
the granites, gneisses and schists. The production of these rapids
is due to the combination of steep slope and the difference between
harder and softer materials, the rapidly-moving waters wearing away
those more easily denuded, while the compact members remain as
obstacles to their advance, and are only slowly worn away along
joint-planes and other lines of weakness. In the Third Cataract,
hard bars of granite rising through softer gneiss at right angles
to the river course have produced the main rapids; elsewhere, as at
the Bab el Kebir, near Wadi Halfa, the river has taken advantage of
a thin dyke of soft rock traversing an extremely<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> hard diorite, so that the stream
has worn a narrow gully between steep rock-walls, where the
intensity of the rush of water is greatly exaggerated owing to its
being restrained and fettered by the narrowness of the passage. In
some cases the same result has been produced owing to the existence
of a line of fracture, or fault, across the stream, the waters
taking advantage of this line of least resistance. The general
erosion in these rapids is accompanied by great local effects where
eddies and whirlpools are produced, and the sand and rocky
fragments act as abrading agents. Pot-holes are formed in the solid
rock, and rapidly deepened by the intense effects of this nature
produced during times of flood, the result being splendidly
illustrated in some of the smaller islands of the First Cataract at
Aswan.</p>

<p>A river is, in fact, the main agent combining the effects of
transformation and reformation, new strata being produced in its
plain tract as the result of the eroding activities in its upper
reaches. Much of the detrital material is also carried seaward to
form deposits of marine sands and muds along the shore-lines of the
continents, these themselves becoming, should subsequent
differential movement of land and sea take place, the sandstones
and clays of future continental areas.</p>

<p>But there are other agencies at work as transformers on and
within the earth’s crust. There are in most rocks a series of
divisional planes, which may be either vertical or inclined, and to
which the name of joints has been given. These may arise from
various causes. Both in sedimentary and igneous rocks they are in
part due to contraction during consolidation—in the former when
they lose their contained water, in the latter when they solidify
from a molten condition. Joints may also be called into being by
the effects of internal pressures and movements within the earth’s
crust, such structures having been experimentally reproduced by
Daubrée in materials under stress by torsion and by simple
pressure. The granite of Aswan displays such jointing to a marked
degree, giving rise to remarkable hills composed of huge boulders
of granite piled on one another.</p>

<h2 class="nopb">V.—CHEMICAL TRANSFORMATION OF ROCKS.</h2>

<p>Besides the mechanical effects of river, rain, and wind, other
changes whose wide-reaching significance cannot be
over-estimated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> are
taking place on and below the earth’s surface. Chemical action is
slowly at work producing effects of the first importance to man.
Rain-water has the power of absorbing important quantities of
carbonic acid gas and oxygen from the atmosphere. On the average,
rain-water contains 1·77 per cent by volume of dissolved carbonic
acid gas, and 33·76 per cent of dissolved oxygen. In passing
through the soil, rain-water also absorbs the organic acids formed
by the decomposition of plant remains. These dissolved gases and
organic acids render rain an active chemical agent in the
alteration of rocks, its effects being conveniently classified
under the headings: (1) Oxidation; (2) Solution; (3) Formation of
Carbonates; and (4) Hydration.</p>

<p>(1) Oxidation results in the formation of thin crusts on the
surface of rocks, the compounds of manganese and iron so frequently
present in them being also rusted or hydrated by the action of the
rain-water. Nothing is more striking than the presence of the dark
films on the desert limestones in regions which are liable to a
certain amount of rainfall, and nothing more convincing as to their
origin than their absence in those portions of the south-western
desert of Egypt where rain is of great rarity. Near the Nile, the
Red Sea and the Mediterranean, dew may take the part of rain in
action, and in a sense the results of its activity may appear more
intense, as rain is liable to wash away the products of its own
handiwork.</p>

<p>(2) The effects of Solution are of the greatest importance,
limestone being soluble to the extent of about 1 part in 1,000 in
water saturated with carbonic acid. In many limestone countries of
the world the solution effects are marked by the production of
underground caves and channels and in some parts of the
north-eastern desert of Egypt, where chalky limestones are the main
constituent, this action has produced remarkable results—large
caves, cylindrical channels, and natural bridges being of not
uncommon occurrence.</p>

<p>(3) Formation of Carbonates. Owing to the rains in Egypt being
of very brief duration, but nevertheless extremely active while
they last, the soluble material in the condition of the unstable
bicarbonate of lime is carried only a short distance, and losing
its loosely combined carbonic acid is redeposited in the cracks of
the rocks, as veins of carbonate of lime, or as the cementing
material by which broken fragments are consolidated into compact
breccias. This action may be seen in the cliff face south of the
Pyramids, near the Sphinx, where<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_16">[16]</span> the sandy limestones forming the top of the
hill have been attached by the rain containing carbonic acid. The
calcareous tests of the shells in the sandy limestones have been
dissolved away, leaving only the sandy internal casts of the shells
behind, and the material so removed has been redeposited in
intricate interlacing veins in a clayey band immediately below. A
vein may sometimes grow by the accretion of successive layers,
which, owing to local causes, such as the relative content of iron
oxide, etc., may display slightly different colours, one of the
results being the production of so interesting a rock as the
Egyptian alabaster, which is a carbonate of lime. As a rule, the
term alabaster is applied to the sulphate rather than to the
carbonate of lime. Probably much carbonate of lime is also carried
in solution to the sea, and there forms the source of the material
which hundreds of living animals seize upon for the production of
the shells in which they dwell. I was much struck last year, during
a journey from the Pyramids to Wasta, to note how the oyster-beds
of one age (the Pliocene) formed themselves upon oyster-beds of a
long preceding period (the Eocene), probably on account of the
greater amount of carbonate of lime at those localities, present
owing to solution of the earlier shell-structures.</p>

<p>That veins of carbonate of lime should be present in limestone
districts is, in view of the above statements, not surprising, but
it does appear somewhat startling at first sight, to find marked
deposits of carbonate of lime lining the floors and sides of
torrent-beds in districts entirely composed of igneous or volcanic
rocks of complicated mineral structure. Experience has shown,
however, that the lime silicates, so abundant in the more basic
members of the igneous series, such as diabases and diorites, are
liable to the attack of the rain-waters containing carbonic acid,
carbonate of lime being produced by the reaction.</p>

<p>(4) Of the results of Hydration, the most striking examples in
Egypt are the formation of kaolin near Aswan, due to the absorption
of water by the felspars of the granitic and gneissose rocks, and
the thick zone of decomposition (kaolinic) products, which was cut
through in excavating the navigation canal in the syenite which
forms the main rock at that locality.</p>

<p>The total effect of all the above-mentioned meteorological
influences results in the weathering of the rock-surface, involving
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> softening and
crumbling of the harder materials, but sometimes leading to the
solidification of materials previously loosely aggregated by
substances left as cementing agents when the water containing them
in solution has evaporated.</p>

<p>In addition to the various direct results of the meteorological
activities upon the earth’s surface, there are others which
indicate more subtle changes. Perhaps amongst the most interesting
of these is the formation of concretions—bodies composed of one
material aggregated in more or less rounded or irregular form in a
rock of another composition. Among the most interesting and
abundant of these are the layers of flint, which form bands of
strikingly parallel character in the limestones of Upper Egypt.
These have not yet been submitted to the detailed study which
similar concretions have received in Europe, but there is little
doubt that they, in large measure, represent the aggregation of
gelatinous silica round decomposing organic materials, the shells
of organisms and the framework of siliceous sponges often forming
their centre. In some cases, as in the fossil trees, the
replacement appears to have taken place molecule by molecule, as
the outlines of every cell of the once woody fibre are now replaced
in silica. By a well-known transition, this once gelatinous
material has now become one of the most solid of substances.</p>

<p>Ferruginous concretions, composed of oxide of iron, are present
in many of the Egyptian sandy clays, some of the beautifully-tinted
purple, yellow and red ochres being found in this form; and the
natives collect them for the use of the women as ornamental
coloration.</p>

<p>Of greater importance to the world at large are the gradual
changes which vegetable matter (collected under specially
favourable circumstances free of all sandy and clayey admixture)
has undergone through vast periods of time, causing the slow
evolution of the oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, originally present,
with a gradual predominance of the carbon. This passage from
vegetable matter to coal has been noted in Egypt in connection with
the Nubian sandstone, beds of carbonaceous material deserving the
name of lignite or even bituminous coal having been found at
various localities. The deposits found up to the present time are
of such tenuity that it is not possible on the evidence available
to express optimistic opinions as to the probable occurrence of
workable coal in Egypt, but still they are of sufficient interest
to be kept constantly in mind while the Geological<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> Survey is prosecuting its
researches. From time to time the finding of coal-seams has been
reported at Edfu, in Kharga, at Saqiet el Teir and Abu Radham<a id=
"FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in
the Eastern Desert, but the efforts hitherto made have resulted in
failure.</p>

<p>The evidence thus far available shows that great rivers were
entering the sea in Nubia during an early geological period (the
Cretaceous), typical fresh-water shells having been found south of
Aswan covered with marine worm-tubes; leaf-imprints are abundant in
some of the sandy layers, and in isolated instances they have
collected in sufficient quantity to give rise to lignite and
bituminous coal-layers of extreme thinness, showing that this
interesting and important change has taken place, at least to some
extent, in Egypt itself. The study of coal-producing regions tends
to show that the change to coal of high commercial value requires
not only conditions favourable to the loss of the more volatile
gases, but also that the beds must have been involved in great
earth-movements, which have hastened the tendency to their being
enriched in carbon, both favourable conditions of deposition and
marked disturbance of the strata being thus required to obtain the
much-desired result.</p>

<p>Other internal chemical activities are at work, producing
changes which are still the cause of debate and earnest study. The
origin of petroleum must undoubtedly be traced to chemical
transformations of a complicated character, if we may judge by the
number of experimental methods which yield petroleum as a product.
All opinions agree that the mineral oil is derived by some form of
chemical action, though whether it arises from the decomposition of
organic remains or whether it be of inorganic origin is still
matter of dispute. Geological students have on the whole ranged
themselves on the side of the first-named view, pointing out that
the petroleum fields are all associated with sedimentary strata,
whether sands or limestones. The inorganic view has been held as
tenaciously by a number of men experienced in the search for oil,
and it is capable of argument that sulphur dioxide and sulphuretted
hydrogen, if being produced simultaneously, may result in the
alteration of limestone to gypsum, free sulphur and petroleum being
also obtained in the reaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>In this connection
it is interesting to note that gypsum, sulphur and petroleum are
associated at Jemsa, on the Gulf of Suez.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features in connection with
petroleum is the phenomenon presented in most oil-fields of
oil-wells separated perhaps by only thirty metres emitting oil
under pressure at the same time; also the great pressures indicated
by the remarkable fountain flows which are of constant occurrence
in the principal petroleum fields.<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href=

<h2 class="nopb">VI.—THE FORMATION OF IGNEOUS ROCKS.</h2>

<p>The external and internal transforming agents are therefore of
the deepest interest and of the highest economic importance, and
the further study of the deep-seated changes leads directly to a
consideration of the formation and sustained activity of the molten
materials which find their main present-day expression in the
phenomena of volcanoes. Their extension in the past is also
revealed by the wearing hand of time in the wide distribution of
coarsely crystalline granites and other igneous rocks, once
deep-seated, but now exposed in regions which are either the cores
of ancient continents or centres of exceptional deformation.</p>

<p>Igneous action and movements of the earth’s crust stand in
intimate relation to one another, a point which has been clearly
stated by Dr. Harker<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a> as follows:—“Setting aside operations
conducted in hypothetical intercrustal magma-basins, or generally
in the unknown depths of the earth’s crust, we recognize the actual
manifestations of igneous action chiefly in the forcing outward of
molten magmas from a lower to a higher level within the crust or
through the crust to the surface.” This study has led directly to
the recognition of three phases of igneous action, of which two are
intrusive, being phases in which the molten materials are raised
from a lower to a higher level within the earth’s crust, and an
extrusive phase, in which these materials are raised to the surface
and poured out there as lavas.</p>

<p>Study in all parts of the world has further shown that these
events follow a definite sequence or cycle of igneous activity,
volcanic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> phenomena
marking its commencement, followed by the movement of deep-seated
igneous molten magmas (representing the plutonic phase), and
closing with a number of minor intrusions, which may seam both the
volcanic, plutonic, and sedimentary strata. Egypt clearly
illustrates this remarkable succession, and thus gives additional
grounds for believing that it is of fundamental importance.
Volcanic activity was developed on a gigantic scale when the most
ancient sediments of Egypt, now forming the folded and altered
slates and schists of the Red Sea hills, were being laid down. To
this part of the cycle belong some of the most interesting rocks of
the country, the imperial porphyry of Dokhan, the dark andesites
that crown the highest summits in Sinai, and the country-rock in
which some of the most ancient of Egypt’s gold-mines are situated.
Here, too, belong the banded and columnar lavas of the Sixth
Cataract, and the fragments of volcanic rocks which play an
important part in the characteristic conglomerates of the Eastern
Desert.</p>

<p>Still more conspicuous is the phase of plutonic activity, vast
masses of granite, diorite, and other highly crystalline rocks as
molten magmas having been in contact with or intruded into the
overlying sediments and volcanic materials. From Sinai to the Sudan
there is a geographical complex due to the intermingling of these
deep-seated igneous rocks with the older and metamorphosed volcanic
and sedimentary members. Desolate volcanic hills of dull-green
shade, whose sides are covered with weathered debris of irregular
outline, alternate with broad plain, out of which rise rounded
masses of granite, or with mountain ranges, whose precipitous sides
and serrated outlines constitute some of the most striking features
of the Red Sea hill scenery.</p>

<p>The final phase, that of the minor intrusions, is admirably
illustrated in Egypt, large areas of the desert consisting of low
ridges formed of parallel bands or dykes of hard rocks, which have
seamed the softer granite, the latter having subsequently been worn
down by erosion. In other cases the dyke is of more basic
composition and more easily denuded than the adjacent rocks.</p>

<p>When these evidences of past igneous activity are examined, they
reveal the interplay of such varied and complicated chemical and
physical effects that a large volume would be required to set forth
the great body of facts observed. Of these only a bare statement of
the most incomplete order must suffice. Igneous rocks are of
very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> variable
chemical composition, and for the purposes of discussion of their
complex relationships have been subdivided into three series
according to the amount of silica they contain, viz.:—The Acid
Rocks with 50 to 70 per cent silica; The Intermediate Rocks with 50
to 60 per cent silica; The Basic Rocks under 50 per cent silica. As
a whole, the igneous rocks are compounds of the silicates of
alumina, magnesia, lime, potash and soda, with oxide of iron; the
silicates of alumina, soda and potash are most abundant at the acid
end of the scale, and those of lime, magnesia, with the oxides of
iron and phosphates at the basic extreme. In consequence, the basic
rocks are usually darker in colour and heavier than the more acid
varieties. Not only have the igneous rocks a varying composition,
but also a varying structure depending on the differences of origin
and position. We may note their history as involving several
stages, viz.:—(1) Solidification from the initial molten magma; (2)
Deformation when under the influence of great earth pressures; (3)
Transformation under the meteorological influences, at or near the
earth’s surface. In addition there are the contact alterations
produced near their junctions with the overlying strata, both
within themselves and in the beds affected by the molten
material.</p>

<p>A molten magma varies greatly in its behaviour according to its
position, the solidification of that portion which remained
deep-seated in the hidden reservoir beneath the earth’s crust
taking place slowly and imperceptibly. A rock such as granite is
not formed suddenly by instantaneous cooling, but step by step
individual minerals are crystallized from the complex solution, and
tend to develop as regular and often most beautiful crystals. It is
a source of surprise to most to learn that the greater number of
mineral substances, if free to develop from solution without
external hindrances, tend to form solid bodies which are fashioned
on geometrical principles, constituting one of the most interesting
and mysterious problems with which scientific thought has to deal.
The minerals, as a rule, tend to crystallize out directly in the
order of their basicity, the oxides of iron with their eight-sided
crystals being among the first, so that their octahedral outlines
are usually well preserved. The other minerals of the rocks follow
in succession; sometimes complicated intergrowths occur owing to
two crystals of different composition starting their formation at
the same time in the same portion of the solution.
Finally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> the
last-formed minerals have to occupy the interspaces left by their
consolidated neighbours, and in the more acid rocks this unenviable
position is usually reserved for the free silica, forming
<em>quartz</em>. These deep-seated masses, slowly solidified and
entirely crystalline in their structure, have been called the
<em>Plutonic</em> rocks, the example familiar to all dwellers in
Egypt being the red Aswan, or monumental granite. In it, the
felspars and micas or hornblendes present tend towards their true
crystal form, while the quartz occupies the interspaces.</p>

<p>Intermediate between the extruded volcanic rocks, and the highly
crystalline varieties of the internal reservoirs of molten
material, are the dyke or hypabyssal rocks, which as narrow
vertical or nearly vertical intrusions pass in all probability from
the deep-seated source towards the surface of the earth, when they
reach it giving rise to volcanic effects. The dykes have a tendency
to be parallel to one another, and in some regions are the most
conspicuous features, if harder than the surrounding rock giving
rise to marked ridges separated in many cases by comparatively
shallow valleys. Not a few of the main summits in the Red Sea hills
and Sinai have assumed their present form and outline owing to the
unequal denudation of one of these hard bands, while many an
ascent, which otherwise would have been by no means free from
danger, is simplified by the formation of gullies due to the
wearing away of the softer and more basic members of this
series.</p>

<p>In the hypabyssal varieties, as well as in surface flows, an
examination of hand-specimens often reveals the presence of larger
crystals (usually termed porphyritic crystals) scattered in a
ground-mass in which no definite structure is visible except under
the microscope. These may in part have been formed before the
molten magma of the rock had begun its upward ascent, but in
general they and the finer-grained base, have crystallized under
similar conditions. Examinations of the ground-mass microscopically
also shows it to be entirely crystalline in its nature, but the
individual components are of very small size.</p>

<p>In the extruded volcanic rocks, on the other hand, the
porphyritic crystals are probably of much earlier date than the
ground-mass in which they are present, the latter being solidified
above-ground, where cooling was rapid, pressure suddenly reduced,
and many of the gaseous constituents were free to escape readily.
As crystals require a certain<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_23">[23]</span> temperature and a slow liberation of the heat
for their formation, in many volcanic rocks the rapid cooling
results in the production of a glass instead of a crystalline
aggregate, so that the presence of a glassy matrix is in itself
evidence of a quick loss of heat.</p>

<h2 class="nopb">VII.—THE FORMATION OF METAMORPHIC ROCKS.</h2>

<p>All materials, both sedimentary and igneous, composing the
earth’s crust, are liable to be involved in movements of
deformation, becoming subject to pressures and chemical agencies,
which are often intense in character and productive of far-reaching
internal changes. The result is the formation of a series of rocks,
which may be of divers origins, but which having lost their
original characteristics, may be grouped as metamorphic. By the
action of compression and dislocation not only are the major masses
folded or broken, but their individual constituents are brought
into new relations both as regards their external conditions and
internal molecular arrangement. Where lateral pressure has been
active as regards the finer-grained rocks, such as clays, the
individual particles arrange themselves with their longer axes at
right angles to the pressure, the result being the production of a
fissile structure or cleavage, totally distinct from the original
bedding-planes of the strata.</p>

<p>Clays under such circumstances pass into slates, in which no
very definite mineral banding is observed, or into schists, in
which there is a tendency for the separate minerals, such as mica
and quartz, to have a pseudo-stratified appearance, though the
individual layers, if closely examined, are found to be lenticular,
not parallel in shape. These schists and slates are developed on a
large scale in the Red Sea hills and Sinai.</p>

<p>The extent to which compression and tension has been carried in
these ancient sedimentary strata is well indicated in Sinai, where
rounded pebbles of quartz have been fractured, the two broken parts
somewhat separated, and the whole re-cemented in a schistose
matrix.</p>

<p>In many instances, besides mechanical stress, another factor of
metamorphism of rocks has to be invoked to explain the phenomena
observed. Mineral changes take place in these rocks which are due
to the superadding of thermal action, consequent on their direct
contact with molten masses of granitic and other plutonic rocks.
In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> Sinai, for
instance, new minerals are called into existence by these contact
effects, members of the <em>andalusite</em> group, which are formed
at high temperatures, being produced near the junctions, garnets
being present in the mica-schists in a zone somewhat further
removed from the contact area, while beyond these is a belt where
the slaty strata show only traces of the formation of the new
minerals in the presence of ill-defined knots, or segregations
forming the so-called “Knotenschiefer” of the Germans.</p>

<p>It is possible to trace the influence of these contact and
dynamic effects, not only in the sedimentary rocks, but also in
those of plutonic origin. An excellent example of such changes,
known as foliation, can be observed in the Dal Cataract, where a
granite is present containing large crystals of red felspar. It is
possible to trace the change of this rock into a variety which
instead of being massive, is banded, the bands containing the
larger red felspars all tending to lie in one plane. These are not
parallel, but lenticular, certain of the minerals, especially the
felspars, remaining comparatively unaffected as “eyes,” round which
the other minerals appear to sweep. The quartz in many instances is
found to be crushed into a mosaic of small grains, and the plates
of mica have been dragged out and separated from one another by the
shearing. These rocks, having a general composition resembling the
granites, have been termed gneisses, and in some cases, similar
effects have been produced by the intrusion of veins of granite
along the horizontal planes of a more basic rock already banded.
This result is well seen in the Third Cataract, where a foliated
rock composed of a white felspar and mica has been pierced by veins
of highly quartzose granite, which has then spread along the laminæ
of the older member.</p>

<p>Similarly in Sinai, the granite, where in contact with the
schistose sedimentary beds, has in certain favourable localities
penetrated between the schistose layers, producing a banded rock
which approaches a gneiss in character.</p>

<p>In Egypt, we are not at present acquainted with such gigantic
overfolding, fracture, and pushing of whole masses of strata one
over the other, as have been studied, for example, in the
North-West Highlands of Scotland, but there is in Egypt itself, a
vast series of gneisses, crystalline schists, marbles and dolomites
whose origin is but dimly understood, and which may represent
changes long anterior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
those exhibited by the ancient rocks of which we have been
speaking. Developed in the untrodden wastes of the Sudan, in the
wilder stretches of the Cataracts, in the desolate regions of the
Etbai Desert of Egypt, their study is attended with difficulty and
all our hypotheses must depend on the comparison of isolated
specimens with similar rocks from more favoured regions.</p>

<h2 class="nopb">SUMMARY.</h2>

<p>1.—Every rock originates either from the solidification of
molten material or of sediments, these constituting the Igneous and
Sedimentary Rocks respectively.</p>

<p>2.—These may undergo deformation due to movements of the earth’s
crust, such movements according to their intensity determining the
re-arrangement of the constituents with the development of new
structures, producing the Metamorphic Rocks.</p>

<p>3.—These varied rocks, when exposed at the earth’s surface, are
brought under the influence of the agents of transformation, such
as frost, contraction and expansion due to variations of
temperature, the mechanical action of rain, sand borne by wind, and
running water in the form of streams. In addition to these purely
physical activities are others of a chemical nature, either
proceeding from changes outside the terrestrial surface (carbonic
acid dissolved in rain, etc.), or from processes operating within
the earth’s crust (production of petroleum, coal, mineral veins,
etc.).</p>

<p>4.—The chemical and physical activities deep within the earth’s
crust result in the formation of the plutonic rocks solidified from
molten solutions, intimately associated with them being the
external manifestations of the working of these hidden forces as
revealed in volcanoes and their associated phenomena.</p>

<p>5.—By the surface changes on the consolidated igneous and other
rocks, the materials are supplied for the formation of some of the
members of the sedimentary series, the sands and clays, while the
limestones in large measure owe their origin to the property
possessed by living animals of constructing shells from the
carbonate of lime brought in solution to the oceans, etc., these
shells, after the death of the animals, contributing to the
formation of the calcareous rocks.</p>
